\usage{
iProMix.eFDR.PermAdd(
  yMatrix,
  x,
  cov = NULL,
  pi,
  reduce1 = c(2, 1),
  reduce2 = NULL,
  CellType = 1,
  cl = F,
  B = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  FDR = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{yMatrix}{The quantitative measure (e.g. protein/expression) of a gene in the matrix form (Row: Genes; Columns: Samples)}

\item{x}{The quantitative measure of anther gene  (e.g. ACE2 protein levels) that we would like to know their cell-type specific dependency with Y}

\item{cov}{The covariates for adjustment. Their impact on the mean value of X and Y are adjusted}

\item{pi}{The proportion of cell type 1}

\item{reduce1}{A index of the row and column of the variance-covariance matrix that should be forced to be zero in cell type 1.  Default is NULL.}

\item{reduce2}{A index of the row and column of the variance-covariance matrix that should be forced to be zero in cell type 2.  Default is NULL.}

\item{CellType}{The cell type to be estimated. Default is 1.}

\item{cl}{True of False. If true, parallel computing is used; need the library(doRNG). Default is FALSE}

\item{B}{The number of permutation}

\item{seed}{Seed for the permutation}

\item{FDR}{FDR cutoff; Default 0.1}
}
\value{
list with 10 elements. It contains
\item{NoSigGene:}{Number of significant genes at the pre-determined FDR cutoff, using consensus voting procedure if B>1}
\item{IdxSigGene:}{The index of significant genes at the pre-determined FDR cutoff, using consensus voting procedure if B>1}
\item{IdxSigGeneEach:}{The index of significant genes at each permutation}
\item{ft_add:}{The iProMix output (e.g. estimated parameters, log likelihoods) using combined original and permutation data (y, x, x_tilde).}
}
